UniRPG is a tool that will help you create RPG, Hack&Slash, Action and Adventure type games in Unity. The goal is to provide a tool with which to create a specific genre of game in Unity without doing any code scripting. Full source is provided and the system supports plugins when you need to do more or expand on the existing features.

Please visit the official site for more information and full feature list.

Offline documentation is provided in the offline-documentation.zip file. Extract this wherever you want access to it. Outside of your ./Assets folder would be best. The online documentation will always be the official and most up to date version of the documentation as I will not update the package each time I make changes to the documentation only. The online docs are at, http://plyoung.com/unirpg/docs/index.html
